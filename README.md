# time-tracker

A simple stopwatch app written in Vuejs. It's (somewhat unique)
feature is that you can attach an arbitrary number of annotations to
each stopwatch "lap".

We persist all data in localStorage

Built with the new CSS Grid properties, so you have to enable that in
chrome://flags or the like.


## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
